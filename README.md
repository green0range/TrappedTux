# About
Tux is trapped in a puzzling maze of walls, spikes, buttons and doors. Can you help him through? This is birds-eye-view puzzle game. It is currently in very early devlopment with only one level.

# Contribute
Trapped Tux is programmed in Python using the Pygame module. I will check all pull requests and add them to the game at my discretion. Artwork/Graphic are also welcome. (I need better spikes)
