TrappedTux is an abandoned game. Designed as a top down puzzle game, this inspired my new project: Wires (https://github.com/green0range/Wires). Although Wires has completely re-written code.

The storyline is about Tux (Linux kernel mascot) being trap in an Antarctic base after a large storm. Take what you want from the project and storyline ideas. It is under GPL.
